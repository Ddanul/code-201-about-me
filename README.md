# code-201-about-me
This is an 'About Me' page started in lab 02
Initially, there are five random questions asked in prompts to gauge the user's knowledge of me.  A response will be given after each answer to see if the user answered the question correctly.

This version includes paired programming.
Nic Cook was the driver.
Danul De Leon was the navigator.

Added CSS hover functionality to the webpage.  Images of each trail will appear when hovering over the Trail name.
